<h2>Dance!!</h2>

<pre>Hello {{cus.get_current_username()}}, this info is extracted from the CurrentUserService.</pre>
<pre>UselessService says: {{us.get_data()}}</pre>

<p>
This is dance component!!... It is not exported, so you can't use it outside its module.
</p>
<p>
However, the dancing banana has been exported so it can be used. Interestingly, it can
be used in this component without any declaration as they are part of the same
module.
