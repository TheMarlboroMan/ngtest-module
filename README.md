#ngtest-module

branches:

v1: 
	Pretty simple so far: the module and main component, a user data component to display user data, a service to grab such data an a pipe to mask the email. No feature modules as such.

v2:
	A feature module for the user-data is created.

v3:
	Added a second service to update the user data, still in the user-data module, reviewing easy template driven stuff. Also communicating two components with a contrived mechanism...

v4:	Change the contrived mechanism to a service with observes: much smaller.
